## Introduction

Carry Protocol is a blockchain project that compensates consumers for sharing offline data and receiving ads, aiming to return control of data privacy and monetization rights back to the consumers.

## Features

1. By using Carry Protocol, merchants are able to receive a cryptocurrency payment, and provide the benefits to the right customers.
3. Consumers can take a full control of their data, and get Carry tokens (CRE) as a reward for sharing the data and receiving the ads.
4. Advertisers are able to select the ad targets and implement advertisements through analyzing the purchase data on the database.


## Problems Solved

Carry empowers and allows individual consumers to take control of their purchase data and its monetization.
