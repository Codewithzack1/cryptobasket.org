## Introduction
Biconomy is a technology company building transaction infrastructure for next-generation web 3 applications. Biconomy is a network relayer infrastructure and a transaction superhighway for Web 3.0 designed to reduce friction between blockchain applications and end users. As such, the startup is helping blockchain developers simplify the onboarding and transaction experience for Web 3.0 projects. The Biconomy team is focused on improving the user experience of decentralized applications to make it easier to work with Web 3.0, which could lead to mass adoption of the product.

Biconomy relay network consists of a software development kit (SDK) and control panel. Its mission is to ease the difficulties associated with opening wallets, buying cryptocurrencies, storing private keys, and paying for gas.

## Features
1. For all stakeholders including node operators, fiduciaries, and liquidity providers, the BICO token offers unique benefits. Node miners are compensated with $BICO matching their donation and BICO stake.
2. $BICO token holders can propose and vote on issues affecting Biconomyâ€™s protocol and the entire network. 
3. Liquidity providers provide liquidity for a wide range of crypto assets across various networks, and when the liquidity pool is used, they receive a nominal fee (as a reward), plus a portion of BICO tokens based on their respective participation in a liquidity pool.
