## Introduction

Mines of Dalarnia is an action-adventure game. Players mine and combine various in-game items, improving their skills and gear to unlock the MoD universe's secrets while fighting enemies and searching for rare relics and artifacts. Delve into the unknown, dark mine, collect minerals and use them to upgrade the character through mining equipment and character attributes


## Features

1. All the items and actions are registered on the blockchain with decentralized governance.
3. Collect rare minerals, upgrade your equipment, compete and win rewards.
4. Open market to trade and exchange NFTs as well as lucrative rewards for land owners.


## Problems Solved

The vision of Mines of Dalarnia (DAR) is to become a multi-layered system that mirrors game roles while enabling all active members to play in-game direction decisions to a degree. DAR plans to become a self-contained, player-owned experience platform that is managed and supported by the community.
