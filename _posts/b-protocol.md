A new DeFi lego primitive, bringing Tradfi systems best practices (a backstop) into DeFi, aiming to stabilize the ever-growing market of DeFi assets which are crucially dependent on adequate liquidation processes - which were missing till now in this young ecosystem.

## Features

1. Shifting profits from bots and miners (MEV) to everyone.
2. Unlocking higher borrowing power for DeFi users.
3. Providing a stronger safety net to DeFi lending platforms.

B.Protocol aims to make lending platforms more capital efficient and stable by incentivizing simple users and professional traders to act as keepers.
