## Introduction
Bifrost is a multichain middleware platform that enables developers to create Decentralized Applications (DApps) on top of multiple protocols. Not restrained to a single blockchain, Bifrost creates a new environment where developers can combine the best protocols to develop substantially more scalable and flexible DApps. Detailed information on what is Bifrost coin BFC and how does it work, how to buy, how much is the price, etc. is in the continuation of the content.

Bifrost Coin (BNC) is the native cryptocurrency of the Bifrost protocol, a Polkadot-based decentralized finance (DeFi) project that provides staking and liquidity. Bifrost allows users to deposit tokens for staking and in return give vTokens that provide staking liquidity. Users who stake tokens receive staking rewards in exchange for locked tokens. BNC Coin is used to collect staking rewards and verify transactions.



## Features
1. Easily switch between blockchains whenever you find a better one.
2. Freely move with multiple blockchains to build the best one for you.
3. Seamlessly integrate multiple blockchains into a single service.
