## Introduction

Audius connects fans directly with artists in a familiar music player interface. With Audius, artists can generate immutable and timestamped records for their creative works, secured by an incentive-aligned decentralized network of node operators.

## Features

1. Unlock premium features for curated engagement by using our native platform token, $AUDIO. From gated content to artist tokens and remix contests, Audius is here to give fans the exclusivity they deserve.

2. As a platform owned and operated by its users, the future of Audius is entirely driven by $AUDIO governance. Everything about Audius is governable, with voting weight directly correlated to $AUDIO staked for value-added services.


## Problems Solved

The music industry generates $43 billion in revenue but only 12% goes to content artists. Furthermore, artists have minimal control over how their music is distributed and little visibility into who is streaming it. To address these and other problems faced by artists, we introduce Audius, a fully decentralized music streaming protocol built with public blockchain infrastructure and other decentralized technologies.
