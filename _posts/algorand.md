## Introduction
We are the world’s most decentralized, scalable, and secure blockchain infrastructure. From decentralized finance to generative NFT art (and everything in between), our sustainable blockchain is powering economic models of the future. Algorand is unleashing scalability, fusing TradFi x DeFi, and accelerating global sustainability. Checkout the ecosystem of organizations powering economic models of the future on Algorand.

## Features
1. Vault is a new cryptocurrency design based on Algorand that minimizes these storage and bootstrapping costs for participants. Vault’s design is based on Algorand’s proof-of-stake consensus protocol and uses several techniques to achieve its goals.
2. We present Pixel, a pairing-based forward-secure multi-signature scheme optimized for use in blockchains, that achieves substantial savings in bandwidth, storage requirements, and verification effort. 
3. . Our protocol is resilient to arbitrary network partitions with unknown length, and recovers fast after the partition is resolved and bounded message delay is restored.

## Vision
A world where everyone creates and exchanges value efficiently, transparently, and securely.
