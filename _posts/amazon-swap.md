## Introduction
AmazonSwap is a project that seeks to solve the main problem of cryptocurrencies: Protecting the environment. We will create a complete ecosystem starting from Dapp up to P2E and use the transaction fees to reward investors through our innovative buyback system (10%), we will also use the fees to finance the platform's ecosystem (60%) and to invest in the Amazon Rainforest protection fund (25%) and to maintain the team (5%).


## Features
1. AmazonSwap DEX is being designed to make SWAP operations easy, as through Live Chats and Limit Order you will be able to know the best moment to execute a trade.
2. Developed with the best security practices in the market, AmazonSwap already has the certificate of trust granted by Auditify. In addition, the privacy of our investors is a priority.
3. You will have in your hands a powerful NFT Marketplace where you can track exclusive INO and also be able to buy and sell your favourite NFTs.
4. We will develop the game MetAmazon, the metaverse game that will have the folklore theme of the Amazon region. It will be an open-world NFT game that will allow interaction between players.
