## Introduction

The Fei Protocol is an autonomous system of smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain that permits, among other things, the generation of Fei, transactions using smart contracts, and lending and borrowing of cryptocurrencies. FEI uses a new kind of stablecoin mechanism called direct incentives, it is more capital efficient, has a fair distribution, and is fully decentralized. The protocol uses the value it controls to maintain liquid secondary markets.



## Features

1. Fei Protocol creates a tight peg by providing $1 redeemability for FEI using PCV
2. Fei algorithmically allocates assets in protocol controlled valued (PCV) to provide liquidity and earn yield
3. TRIBE token holders manage the PCV, backing FEI with a community-owned reserve.
4. Fei Protocol only holds decentralized assets and focuses on DeFi-native partnerships with other DAOs, like LaaS.

## Problems Solved

Fiat-collateralized stablecoins like USDC and USDT are centrally controlled, crypto-collateralized stablecoins like DAI have scalability issues due to capital inefficiency. This is a problem Fei wanto so solve by creating an entirely decentralized stablecoin.
