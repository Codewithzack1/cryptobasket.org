## Introduction
Boba Network is an Optimistic Rollup that combines the great open source work done by Optimism with the research and development effort of the Enya & Boba team on swap-based onramp, fast exit and cross-chain bridging. We chose to build on Optimism because it is essentially a modified version of Ethereum, which makes it relatively easy to ensure EVM and Solidity compatibility, minimizing the efforts required to migrate smart contracts from L1 to L2.


Boba offers fast exits backed by community-driven liquidity pools, shrinking the Optimistic Rollup exit period from seven days to only a few minutes, while giving LPs incentivized yield farming opportunities.


## Features

1. Transactions that cost less than a Boba.
2. Get your money inminutes (not days,not even hours).
3. Mint, move, and sellbetween L2 & L1,no problem
4. Ape-scale capable smartcontracts that can trigger AWS Lambda.
5. No multisig wallets here.
