## Introduction
Alchemix Self-Repaying Loans allow you to leverage a range of tokens without risk of liquidation. By borrowing a synthetic version of the asset you deposit you'll avoid the risk of liquidation. Defi innovation on a whole new level, Alchemix is the first same-asset loan product in DeFi. Using your collateral we earn yield on your behalf to pay off your loan automagically.


## Features
1. Keep exposure to important assets while making them work for you. Leverage more of your wealth (without risk of liquidation!) by borrowing a synthetic version of your collateral.
2. Alchemix is opening doors to new collateral types. Leverage more of your wealth than ever before.
3. No matter what happens we'll never liquidate your deposit. You can choose to self-liquidate your own loan at your own discretion.
4. Alchemix doesn't lock your deposit or charge you fees. Your funds are accessible 100% of the time. You can also repay your debt whenever you like.
