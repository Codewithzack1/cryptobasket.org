## Introduction
Bluzelle is a blockchain for GameFi with its ability to produce high quality games, protect players NFTs, and leverage DeFi yields with its 10,000 TPS Cosmos-Based Blockchain.
Our mission is the ensure creators can control their intellectual property free from gatekeepers.



## Features
1. A fully decentralized storage layer that stores Game NFTs across a number of nodes instantly. This ensures players don't lose their hard earned NFTs.
2. Aggregates DeFi products in the Cosmos ecosystem to offer lending, staking, and yield strategies for game assets.



## Problem Solved
Currently games on Ethereum are facing high scaling issues and enormous transaction fees. This is not conductive when players are constantly buying, selling and trading NFT assets. At the same time NFTs are stored on a centralized server which can go down and lose the assets the player acquired. To bring in the next billion crypto users through gaming, there needs to be a better experience.
The solution is Bluzelle with it's four point framework.
