## Introduction

Celsius network is a regulated, SEC compliant, lending platform that enables users to receive interest on deposited cryptocurrencies or take out crypto collateralized loans. The system is based around their native token CEL, which is used to take loans, provide rewards, and make payments. It's also a cryptocurrency app that enables the purchase of 10 specific cryptos that can be converted to more than 30 other e-currencies.
## Features
1. Earn up to 17% APY on your crypto
2. Buy crypto with your bank account or credit card
3. Swap crypto with zero fees.
4. Everything we do at Celsius is designed for unparalleled access to fair, rewarding financial services. Fees hold people back, so we removed them. But we didnâ€™t stop there.
