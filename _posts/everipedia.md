## Introduction
Everipedia's vision is to bring blockchain knowledge to the world and knowledge onto the blockchain, helping verify facts in an era of misinformation and unlocking a new class of use cases in the blockchain space.


## Features
1. Everipediaâ€™s design and features have been built for the modern age.
2. Everipedia allows you to create an article about anything as long as you have a citation. This allows for a much broader scope of content in the knowledge base.
3. Anyone with IQ Tokens is a stakeholder in the Everipedia Network. Using IQ tokens to vote, users decide which new articles and edits are added to the knowledge base.
