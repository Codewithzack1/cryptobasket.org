## Introduction
Celo is a mobile-first blockchain that makes decentralized financial (DeFi) tools and services accessible to anyone with a mobile phone. It aims to break down barriers by bringing the powerful benefits of DeFi to the users of the 6 billion smartphones in circulation today. The company’s mission is to build a financial system that creates the conditions of prosperity for everyone. Celo enables native and non-native digital assets–both cryptographic and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)–to circulate freely across devices, carriers, and countries. This makes money mobile, global and accessible like never before. Celo is supported by a community of organizations and individuals, including Jack Dorsey, a16z, and Deutsche Telekom.


 
## Features
1. A growing family of user-friendly stablecoins like cUSD, cEUR, cREAL, USDC, and more, accessible via mobile and desktop devices.
2. Popular Ethereum tooling and full support for ERC-20 like tokens make it easy to port dApps over.
3. Permissionless consensus algorithm powered by decentralized, carbon-negative infrastructure.
4. Authenticate users by mapping their phone numbers to public keys to enable seamless mobile-first experiences.
5. Build applications that enable cross-chain communication across a growing number of compatible chains.
