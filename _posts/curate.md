## Introduction

Curate is the world's first blockchain agnostic gasless physical goods and
NFT marketplace that also serves as a gasless multichain bridge between
major chains such as ETH,BNB, ALGO, EGLD, AVAX. CURÉ… TE is built on its own native marketplace allowing buyers and sellers to exchange physical and digital goods such as gaming, electronics, NFTs,
clothing, fashion and more.


## Features

1. A blockchain agnostic gasless NFT and physical goods marketplace
with an in-built wallet
3. A propriatary blockchain built from the ground up in GO that provides
the gasless infrastructure and near instant transaction finality in app
with full transparency 
4. Seamless and gasless bridging between different blockchains -
Blockchain agnostic.

## Problems Solved

The goal here is to adopt and implement the blockchain technology in another area of daily life, which is the online marketplace industry use case. There is no Singular NFT marketplace that supports major blockchains and provided wallet capabilities. There is a Lack of an easy to use, intuitive app. UX experience is not user-friendly for the average retail user hindering mass adoption.
