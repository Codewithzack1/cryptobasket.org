## Introduction
Defi for music artists, sports, and content creators.CEEK directly connects music artists, athletes, and other digital content creators directly to their fans in virtual worlds. CEEKâ€™s platform enables the tokenization of smart tickets for content creators, which can track and verify sales of tickets and digital assets on the CEEK blockchain. This ensures royalty payouts to creators through immutable data on a ledger.

## Features
1. Transactions are more secure, transparent and provide an immutable record of exchanges on the blockchain.
2. By utilizing the blockchain, CEEKERS will be able to access, manage and exchange digital assets at a fraction of the cost. Using a special standard for multi-token transfer will reduce gas cost down to approximately 1/10th of a cent.
3. Open Standards allow CEEKERS the ability for true ownership of digital items that will traverse multiple digital reality environments.
