## Introduction
The Helium network is a wide-area wireless networking system, a blockchain, and a protocol token. The blockchain runs on a new consensus protocol, called the Helium Consensus Protocol, and a new kind of proof, called Proof-of-Coverage. The Miners who are providing wireless network coverage in a cryptographically verified physical location and time submit proofs to the Helium network, and the Miners submitting the best proofs are elected to an asynchronous byzantine fault tolerant consensus group at a fixed epoch.

## Features
1. The People's Network is built on Open Source technology and governed by an open alliance.
2. Say goodbye to expensive cell contracts. On Helium a sensor can cost cents to run a year.
3. Utilize thousands of existing sensors, chipsets and MCUs for streamlined development.
