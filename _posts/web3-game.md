## Introduction
WEB3 Game, is an unique play-to-earn game that strives to return ownership back to the gamers. Like many of the traditional games, all characters, items, rewards and any of the digital assets that gamers received within in-game are the culmination of the gamers’ effort, time and money. The game is built on a tactical role-playing format that combines RPG features with $WEB3 GAME tactics.

## Features
1. Three Classes Sword Kobold, Archer Kobold, and Mystic Kobold are the three in-game battling units that players can choose from. In the $WEB3 GAME universe, you can explore, gather resources, develop strong warriors, raid bosses, upgrade your equipment, and even compete in tournaments.
2. Pure entertainment with the aim for passive income To suit many different types of users, the gameplay is designed with simplicity with multiple missions, PvP, tournaments for users to participate to enhance their gaming experience. For the more advanced players, there are boss stages, tournaments and PvP which integrates fighting and tactical options.
3. Encourage game ownership and giving control back to gamers With the ability to convert in-game warriors and equipment to NFT, gamers will not only gain a sense of achievement but also become the real owners of Kobold Wars. In the near future, DAO will be developed where any in-game development will be consulted and decided by the owners of the governance tokens.


## Token Utility
1. Play To Earn In order to participate in Kobold War games, participants would need to purchase $WEB3 GAME as an ingame currency where there are daily missions to complete to accumulate “shards” which may then be used to purchase equipment, level-up characters and even participate in mystery box jackpot draw that may return 10-100x $WEB3 GAME.
2. NFT Marketplace In fact, the in-game warriors and equipment may be unlocked as NFTs once certain level of warriors has been attained within the social NFT marketplace. The minted NFT may be secured with your ownership and stored on the blockchain. An NFT ecosystem may then be created for gamers to transact their warriors and equipment.
