## Introduction

Flux is the new generation of scalable decentralized cloud infrastructure. Simply develop, manage, and spawn your applications on multiple servers at once. Ready for Web 3.0, dApps, and more. Flux provides the critical, high availability infrastructure for the New Internet. Projects and development teams are not forced to rely on the Flux blockchain to utilize FluxOS, so they have access to necessary infrastructure while maintaining all the unique properties of their own chains. Flux makes up one important piece of a well-balanced distributed computing portfolio focused on the next generation of the Internet.



## Features
1. Flux network is fully decentralized making it highly resilient to both system failure and outside attempts at censorship. Nodes are collateralized and managed by Flux node operators.
2. FluxOS is fully compatible with any blockchain and any hardened dockerized applications. You can run any application on any blockchain on FluxOS.
3. FluxOS applications are redundantly spread across the node network with automatic failover to a new node if one becomes unavailable.
4. Deployment and management of applications launched on Flux is API or UI backed, allowing for seamless integration with your services.
