## Introduction
Convex Finance is a platform built to boost rewards for CRV stakers and liquidity providers alike, all in a simple and easy to use interface. Convex aims to simplify staking on Curve, as well as the CRV-locking system with the help of its native fee-earning token. Liquidity providers earn trading fees and claim boosted CRV without locking CRV themselves.


## Features
1. Deposit your Curve LP tokens to earn Curve trading fees, boosted CRV and CVX tokens.
2. Boost is pooled from CRV stakers so you do not need to worry about locking yourself.
3. Stake and earn additional CRV on top of CVX tokens and Curve trading fees.
4. Stake your CVX rewards back into the platform and earn platform fees.
