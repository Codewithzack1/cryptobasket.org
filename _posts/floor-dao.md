## Introduction

FloorDAO is a decentralized NFT market-making protocol. It aims to enable deep liquidity for NFT collections through the use of Protocol Controlled Value and yield-generating strategies, starting with NFTX vaults.

## Features

1. Profit in the treasury backs newly minted floor which is awarded to users staked in the protocol.
2. A combination of bond sales and yield from automated NFT market-making generates profit for treasury.
3. gfloor holders vote on which collections to add to the treasury via bonding, generating further profit from nft trading activity.


## Problems Solved

FloorDAO solves the problem of trading fees that flow back to the exchangeâ€™s centralized controllers in centralized NFT markets by bridge the gap between DeFi and NFT, creating new performance strategies and use case.
