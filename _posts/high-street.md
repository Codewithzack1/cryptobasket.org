## Introduction
Highstreet is a decentralized Metaverse and MMORPG where brands, both traditional and crypto, can use our Merchant Portal to seamlessly integrate and build their presence in Highstreet World. From day 1, Highstreet strives for interoperability and already has major thought leaders from exchanges like Binance, blockchains like AVAX, to funds like Everyrealm and Animoca integrated with our "metaverse as a service" layer.

Beyond crypto projects, brands like Balenciaga and LVMH are extending their reach as well to video games in order to expand new market. With the rise in popularity of NFTs, many brands are further tapping into the on-chain industry Adidas with their very own Bored Ape, and even Harvey Nichols with their own NFT drops. It is without a doubt that the future of retail and commerce is entertainment. 

## Features
1. We already live our life half online and half in real life. The products on our market are crafted to exist both in physical and virtual form and always come straight from the brands.
2. Never wait for buyers and sellers. Our StreetSmartâ„¢ Bonding Curves enable our marketplace to directly buy and sell product tokens at a dynamic fair market value 24/7.
3. Goodbye Fakes. Product tokens are linked directly to the brands and creators you love. Products redeemed on Highstreet will always come directly from the source. Fresh out the oven.
