## Introduction
Decred is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency with a strong focus on community input, open governance, and sustainable funding for development. It utilizes a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mining system to ensure that a small group cannot dominate the flow of transactions or make changes to Decred without the input of the community. A unit of the currency is called a decred.

## Features
1. Decred employs an innovative hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake system that layers security and carefully aligns incentives.
2. Decredâ€™s built-in governance systems empower its community with formal rights to make consensus changes and manage project-level decisions. 
3. Decred continuously funds its treasury with 10% of each block reward and employs a flexible contractor model that allows contributors to receive compensation for their work.
