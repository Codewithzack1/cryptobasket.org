## Introduction
Hegic is a protocol for trustless creating, maintaining and settling of hedge contracts. Hedge contract is an options*-like on-chain contract that gives the holder (buyer) a right to buy or to sell an asset at a certain price (strike) as well as imposes the obligation on the writer (seller) to buy or to sell an asset during a certain period. It can be useful for the market participants who want to protect their assets from the price downside and for the liquidity providers who might find the returns on writing hedge contracts attractive enough to allocate some of their capital on the liquidity pool contract.


## Features
1. The options prices on Hegic are automatically set lower than on the centralized exchanges such as Deribit. Pay less in premiums because the lowest options prices are on Hegic.
2. 100% of your gas fees (transaction fees) will be covered by Hegic. You won't need to migrate your funds anywhere. Currently applies for the options trades with a minimum size of 10 ETH or 1 WBTC.
3. Hegic won't ask to share your email, ID or your name. You're the boss here.
