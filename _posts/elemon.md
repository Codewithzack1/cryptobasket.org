## Introduction
Elemon hosted on BSC - is a platform that features tokenized Digital creatures in a virtual universe. This leverages the unique feature of Non-Fungibility that ERC-721 offers. ERC721 is a standard for representing ownership of non-fungible tokens, this implies that each token is unique such as in collectibles or real estate.
Elemon aims to be the first ecosystem to combine the thrill of gaming and the value of digital collectibles, transforming it into the digital creatureâ€™s universe. Elemon will make use of a nextlevel NFT- based gameplay and integrate it with a blockchain-based decentralized financial system, making the game not only for fun but also an investment.

## Vision
Elemon strongly believes that in the near future, the Blockchain-based play-to-earn market will boom and become more popular in this digital era.
With Elemon, we hope that the increasingly strong Blockchain-applied financial market will be spead more widely in the world.
