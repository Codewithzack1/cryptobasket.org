## Introduction

MediBloc is creating a patient-centered health data ecosystem that
can protect individual privacy and maximize the reliability of health data by developing ‘Panacea’, a high-performance blockchain optimized for health data exchange.

In a decentralized, tamper-proof blockchain-based data ecosystem,
we can finally have sovereignty over our own data and use our health information
according to our own needs.

## Features

1. MediBloc is a patient-centered health data platform developed based on the blockchain Panacea and designed to connect fragmented health data.
2. Through MEDIBLOCyou can store, access, update, manage and effectively share,transact and give account of your own health data even among medical practitioners for treatment purposes, institutions and researchers for further innovations and get paid.
3. The MediBloc platform offers its users a digital wallet which allows users to quickly and securely access their digital health data and records.

## Problems Solved
Recently electronic health records are centrally preserved and stored by medical institutions.Medical privacy laws also have it that medical health records should be exclusively obtainable by patients, giving healthcare providers primary stewardship of patients data. And this has posed a threat to the holistic understanding of patients medical status. And also diminishing patients quality care due to incessant and concurrent scattering of data across various institutions.

MediBlocoffers a healthcare data exchange platform/ecosystem, that will promote enteroparability and allow all entities,patients, practitioners, medical institutions to freely take part in exchange data.
