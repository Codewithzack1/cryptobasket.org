## Introduction
With Boson Protocol you can build commerce applications that everyone can trust and anyone can use. Built for creators, communities and merchants, Boson Protocol enables the seamless exchange of digital assets for physical products, services and experiences.

## Features
1. Boson Protocol's exchange mechanism enables anyone to trade physical products for on-chain value by tokenizing a commitment to exchange as an NFT
2. Bosonâ€™s ERC-20-based Thing Tokens integrate with existing DeFi infrastructure to enable liquid digital marketplaces for any physical or digital item
3. Users can monetize their own commerce data by voluntarily opting into Web3 data marketplaces, giving them an equitable share of the proceeds
